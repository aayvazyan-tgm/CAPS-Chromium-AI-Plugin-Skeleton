Project Requirements

What to Create: Entrants must build a working software application that uses Kiro (vibe coding, agent hooks, steering docs, MCP, or specs) and submit it into one of the following categories (each a “Project”). 

 

Categories:


Resurrection: Bring your favorite dead technology back to life. Reimagine obsolete tech with today’s innovations or solving tomorrow's problems.


Frankenstein: Stitch together a chimera of technologies into one app. Bring together seemingly incompatible elements to build something unexpectedly powerful.


Skeleton Crew: Build a skeleton code template lean enough to be clear but flexible enough to support various use cases. Show us its versatility with two distinct applications from your foundation.


Costume Contest: Build any app but show us a haunting user interface that’s polished and unforgettable. Bring in spooky design elements that enhance your app’s function.

 

Functionality: The Project must be capable of being successfully installed and running consistently on the platform for which it is intended and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.

Platforms: A submitted Project must run on the platform for which it is intended and which is specified in the Submission Requirements. 

New & Existing: Projects must be either newly created by the Entrant or, if the Entrant’s Project existed prior to the Hackathon Submission Period, must have been significantly updated and must solve for a new use case after the start of the Hackathon Submission Period. Entrants should explain how their Project was significantly updated and what new use case it solves for during the Submission Period.

Third Party Integrations: If a Project integrates any third-party SDK, APIs and/or data, Entrant must be authorized to use them in accordance with any terms and conditions or licensing requirements of the tool.

 

Submission Requirements 

Submissions to the Hackathon must meet the following requirements:

Include a Project built with the required developer tools and meets the above Project Requirements.

Include a text description that should explain the features and functionality of your Project.

Include a demonstration video of your Project. The video portion of the Submission:

should be less than three (3) minutes. Judges are not required to watch beyond three minutes 

should include footage that shows the Project functioning on the device for which it was built

must be uploaded to and made publicly visible on YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook Video, or Youku, and a link to the video must be provided on the submission form on the Hackathon Website; and

must not include third party trademarks, or copyrighted music or other material unless the Entrant has permission to use such material.

Provide a URL to your open source code repository for judging and testing. 

The repository must contain all necessary source code, assets, and instructions required for the project to be functional. The repository must be public and open source by including an open source license file. This license should be detectable and visible at the top of the repository page (in the About section).

The code repository must be public with an approved OSI Open Source License

Here are some instructions from Github on how to add it

Your repo must contain the /.kiro directory at the root of the project to show usage of specs, hooks, and steering. Do NOT add the /.kiro directory or sub-folders to your .gitignore, as this could disqualify your submission.

For Skeleton Crew projects only: Your repo must contain 2 separate repo folders for the 2 separate applications.

Identify which category and bonus category you are submitting into.

Provide a write up on how Kiro was used. Judges must understand how effectively you used Kiro to develop your project. Show us your next-level understanding of Kiro features, e.g.:

Vibe coding: How did you structure your conversations with Kiro to build your project? What was the most impressive code generation Kiro helped you with?

Agent hooks: What specific workflows did you automate with Kiro hooks? How did these hooks improve your development process?

Spec-driven development: How did you structure your spec for Kiro to implement? How did the spec-driven approach improve your development process? How did this compare to vibe coding?

Steering docs: How did you leverage steering to improve Kiro’s responses? Was there a particular strategy that made the biggest difference?

MCP: How did extending Kiro’s capabilities help you build your project? What sort of features or workflow improvements did MCP enable that otherwise would have been difficult or impossible?

 

Multiple Submissions 

An Entrant may submit more than one Submission, however, each Submission must be unique and substantially different from each of the Entrant’s other Submissions, as determined by the Sponsor and Devpost in their sole discretion.

Submission ownership

Be the original work of the Entrant, be solely owned by the Entrant, and not violate the IP rights of any other person or entity.

 

Testing 

Access must be provided to an Entrant’s working Project for judging and testing by providing a link to a website, functioning demo, or a test build. If Entrant’s website is private, Entrant must include login credentials in its testing instructions. The Entrant must make the Project available free of charge and without any restriction, for testing, evaluation and use by the Sponsor, Administrator and Judges until the Judging Period ends. Judges are not required to test the Project and may choose to judge based solely on the text description, images, and video provided in the Submission.
 

6. Judges & Criteria
Eligible submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor (the “Judges”). Judges may be employees of the sponsor or third parties, may or may not be listed individually on the Hackathon Website, and may change before or during the Judging Period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the sponsor. 

Stage One) The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the ideas meet a baseline level of viability, in that the Project reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required APIs/SDKs featured in the Hackathon.

Stage Two) All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

Potential Value

Includes the extent to which the solution can be widely useful, easy to use, accessible, etc. Examples of considerations could include:

How unique or saturated the market is with these kinds of applications/solutions

Whether the UI is intuitive and brings the app functionality to the next level

If there is a clear need, extensibility, or other type of scalability of the Project


Implementation

Includes how well the idea is leveraging Kiro. Judges must understand how effectively Kiro was used to develop the project. Examples of effective usage include but are not limited to:

The variety of Kiro features/capabilities impactful in project development

The depth of understanding or benefit gained from a given Kiro feature/capability

The amount of experimentation and strategic decisions made in how Kiro features/capabilities are brought into the individual’s development workflow.




Quality and Design

Includes creativity, originality, and polished design of the project, such as: 

Finding and using unique public resources like datasets

Solving a challenge in a unique way

Building in delightful UI experiences or other thoughtful choices

 

The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable prizes. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.The Judges also have discretion to award up to 2 additional discretionary Influencer Judges Choice prizes based on the same criteria.

Tie Breaking 

For each Prize listed below, if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions’ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.
